---Bank System in C++---

I made this project on 17.09.2025.
This Project is a simulation of a banking system
The Money is not REAL!

It's a bank system made in C++ using classes, but in the code, void dominances. That means that I mostly
used voids. When u run the code, you would need to put the password to get in. The password is the date that I made
the code in. After you entered the password, you would see 3 menus: 1. Personal Account, 2. Credit Account 3. Exit (do I need to explain this to you?)

The Personal Account is you're normal account and you have in balance of 5000$ (ofc not real), you can withdraw or
Deposit money there, and it will be saved.

The Credit Account is the account where you get credit (borrow money) from a bank, and you will need to pay back is 2x money you borrowed. (100% real experience)
If you paid more than you're debt was, the system would not care and would not give you your money back. When you get credit, you can't get more than how much of money you have in your balance,
so take less because I said so.

Here are some essential details:
1. Password: 17092025
2. This is just a simulation, not a real banking system.
3. The system is so easy that a monkey would understand it.
